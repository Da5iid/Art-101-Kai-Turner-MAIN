			<h1> Lab 8: Anon Functions </h1>

				<p> This lab was an investigation to the magical and confusing world of
					anonamous functions!</p>
			<h2> Challenges </h2>
				<p> Our biggest problem was trying to understand what exacly the fuctions
					are doing, and why you need all this extra syntax to write a timer. Our
					best guess is that since you need to define both the function you're
					passing over, and also the time that it needs to wait before it can
					actually run that function, you need to format it in this confusing
					way so that JS knows which is which.</p>
			<h2> Problems </h2>
				<p> Initially, things went pretty smooth, copying over the code from the
					assignment mostly. The problems arrose when we attempted to actually
					print the values of the functions onto our HTML page. That took a bunch
					of troubleshooting, but we eventually figured out that if we used the
					HTML buttons from the last lab, and enclosed each part of the functions
					in a runCode function, that it would properly connect over. Functions in
					functions in functions >:3</p>

				<button onclick="runTest1()">Run Test 1!</button>
				<button onclick="runTest2()">Run Test 2!</button>
				<button onclick="runTest3()">Run Test 3!</button>
