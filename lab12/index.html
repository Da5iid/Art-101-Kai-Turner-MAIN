			<h1> Lab 12: If/Else statements! </h1>
				<p> The purpose of this lab was to introduce us (super late) to the idea
					of If/Else structures and computational logics! Pretty chill, suprised
					we learned it so late into the quarter tho.</p>
			</div>

			<h2> Challenges </h2>
				<p> One of the challenges we faced was getting the syntax of the JQuery
					stuff to work. It was confusing because instead of using .value for the
					'value' of the form input, JQuery uses '.val' which is something that we
					had to look up. But it works now so that's cool!</p>
				</div>

				<div id= "problems">
			<h2> Problems </h2>
				<p> Lu ran into a small problem with their CSS and JS not being linked
					correctly, but we were able to sort it out pretty quickly. I ran into
					a couple problems with trying to debug small syntax errors within my code,
					such as missing a () after a function declaration and the bit I mentioned
					earlier with not being able to find the right syntax for .val.</p>
