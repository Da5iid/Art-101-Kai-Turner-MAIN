			<h1> Lab 7: Fun Functions </h1>
				<p> This lab was to see if we were functionally able to function when presented
					with a challenge to make a function, which in and of itself is a function of
					making functions, and of course as we remember, a function of how society functions.</p>
			<h2> Challenges </h2>
				<p> While stack overflow saved me pretty quickly in most cases, we did have
					a little bit of trouble getting the "start" HTML button to work and link
					correctly to my external JS file. Every example found online showed the JS
					code being embedded within the HTML, something we're not doing here obviously,
					so we had to improvise.</p>

			<h3>Script Output! (Results)</h4>
			<p>This is the output of our Javascript!</p>
				<ul>
					<button onclick="squareRootPrompt()">Square Root Calculator</button>
					<button onclick="nameWarp()">Name 'Fixer'</button>
				</ul>
