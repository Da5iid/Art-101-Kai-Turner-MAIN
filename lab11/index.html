			<h1> Lab 11: JQuery O' Clock </h1>
				<p> The purpose of this lab was to experiment with jQuery! Using the cool
					$ function to find html elements, we were able to pop off and append some buttons to our html!</p>
			</div>

				<div id= "challenges">
			<h2> Challenges </h2>
				<p> One of the challenges we faced was figuring out the syntax of the different
					JQ functions, and also deciding how to append the buttons correctly to the div
					objects. Once we found the right syntax tho, things went much smoother!</p>
				</div>

				<div id= "problems">
			<h2> Problems </h2>
				<p> Both Lu and I ran into a problem that when using teletype within Atom
					to share our CSS and JS files, that teletype would prevent the CSS file
					from being read by our website, thus breaking the styles for it. When we
					closed the teletype window, everything worked again, but it tool at least
					20 minutes to diagnose and figure it out. Chaos.</p>
