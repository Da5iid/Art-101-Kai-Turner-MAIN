			<h1> Lab 3: File Structures and File Transfer </h1>
				<p> The subject of this lab was to expand a local web file structure, and
					begin the process of building our homepage that will eventually host all
					of the labs we complete for this class. </p>
			<h2> Challenges </h2>
				<p> While my grasp of HTML and css is expanding rapidly, I still had some
					difficulty with trying to get page elements to lie in the right spots
					 in relation to each other. I eventually want my perlin noise P5 graphic
					 to be a vertical column next to the rest of the contents of my pages,
					 but I have yet to find a way to implement that easily. Things to think
					 about for future labs.</p>
			<h3> Results of Work </h3>
				<p> I'm kinda proud with how my pages are coming so far! I've been able to
					 implement a color scheme and formatting that I'm digging within my 3
					 labs so far. Also, being able to re-use the perlin noise toppo P5.JS from
					 a different class has been super nice, though it does not always work
					 perfectly on Chrome. Your results may vary. #FirefoxGang #BestBrowser</p>
